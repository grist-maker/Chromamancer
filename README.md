# Chromamancer
A 2-week 5-student rapid prototyping project exploring the games that go beyond entertainment. Chromamancer is a JRPG inspired painting combat game with a colorblind filter designed to garner empathy for colorblind users and encourage developers to implement accessibility features.
It is downloadable from the itch.io page due to the size limit of GitHub file uploads.
